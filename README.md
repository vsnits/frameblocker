quickly search and get information where it is impossible to read. <br>
Frameblock frequently works `where usual` ad blockers are `powerless`
# Problems
Of course, you can lose a part of the content, because FrameBlock does not support web apps. <br>
We can exclude the most popular ones from from the list of sites which affected by FrameBlock <br>
and weekly updating our list of trusted sites, but it's impossible to know them all. <br>
As a result, you may see less animations or even lose functionality. <br>
However, you can report the problem if you think the website is worth so.
